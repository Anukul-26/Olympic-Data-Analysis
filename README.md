# Olympic Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing Olympic athlete data using Python, Pandas, and NumPy. The data is sourced from the [Kaggle Olympic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results) and includes two primary CSV files: `athlete_events.csv` and `noc_regions.csv`.

– Conducted EDA on Olympic Games data (1869-2016),used Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and trend analysis.
– Executed data preprocessing: cleansing, missing value handling, duplicate removal, and one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
– Developed an interactive web app with Streamlit,using Plotly, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for visualizations.

## Project Structure

- **`athlete_events.csv`**: Contains detailed information about athletes and their performances in various Olympic events.
- **`noc_regions.csv`**: Provides the mapping between National Olympic Committees (NOCs) and the corresponding regions.
