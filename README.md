This project involves analyzing Olympic athlete data using Python, Pandas, and NumPy. The data is sourced from the [Kaggle Olympic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results) and includes two primary CSV files: `athlete_events.csv` and `noc_regions.csv`.

## Project Structure

- **`athlete_events.csv`**: Contains detailed information about athletes and their performances in various Olympic events.
- **`noc_regions.csv`**: Provides the mapping between National Olympic Committees (NOCs) and the corresponding regions.
